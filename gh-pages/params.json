Methods such as the ones used in BigsDB(1), are based on draft\r\ngenomes (DGs) produced by de novo assemblies from reads, and BLAST based\r\nmethodologies match the loci on DGs to existing allelic databases. However when novel\r\nalleles are found, they should be validated since the variation could be an artifact\r\nintroduced by the de novo assembler. Thus, the role of our work is to create AVT\r\n(Allele Validation Tool), a tool that is capable of validate novel alleles found in de\r\nnovo assemblers by allele calling algorithms.The proper validation of an allele can be of\r\nextreme importance, specially in the correct detection of outbreak situations based on\r\nwgMLST.\r\nThe inputs for AVT are the reads of the strains under study, the contigs\r\nproduced by the de novo assembler and a list of all the novel alleles found. AVT uses a\r\nsequence mapper such as Bowtie2 (2), and samtools/bfctools (3), to detect any SNPs\r\nand validate coverage over the length of the allele. The output will report any\r\nSNP/indels found or if the allele is confirmed.\r\nAs future work, we plan on providing the tool as a web application and also as a\r\nstandalone application (based on python and browser compatible languages) so\r\neveryone can access it easily. Moreover, we also want to make our code open source so\r\neveryone can contribute and improve it to fit their best needs.\r\n\r\n##References\r\n* (1) Jolley, KA and Maiden M.
